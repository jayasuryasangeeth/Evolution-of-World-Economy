Some of the sample insights are :-

The line graphs provided depict the trends in employee income and inflation across several countries. By analyzing the graphs, we can draw important conclusions about the relationship between these two variables.

 For instance, let us consider the United States. By selecting the United States on both graphs, we can see that income and inflation do not correlate well with each other. From 2009 to 2010, there was an increase in income, and from 2009 to 2010, there was a decrease in inflation. This suggests that income and inflation are inversely correlated.

 In general, an increase in income may result in an increase in demand for goods and services, leading to an increase in prices (inflation). On the other hand, a decrease in income may lead to a decrease in demand and a decrease in prices (deflation).

 However, as seen in the example of the United States, this correlation between income and inflation is not always straightforward. There can be other factors at play, such as changes in government policies, shifts in global economic conditions, and fluctuations in supply and demand for specific goods and services.

 It's also worth noting that the trends in income and inflation can vary widely between different countries. For instance, some countries may experience high inflation rates despite increases in income due to other factors such as currency devaluation, while others may have low inflation rates despite stagnant income growth.

After analyzing available data, including income per person and SDI, we found that happier countries (Denmark, United States) tend to have a higher income per person than less happy countries (India, Georgia). But it's not all straightforward - many factors come into play. We also observed that less happy nations and rapidly developing ones have positive SDI growth, whereas established and happier nations have seen a decline over the years.

There could be multiple reasons for this behavior. One possible explanation could be that countries with lower levels of happiness may be putting more emphasis on economic growth and development to improve the well-being of their citizens, while countries with higher levels of happiness may be more focused on maintaining their quality of life rather than solely on economic growth. Additionally, some countries may have unique economic or social conditions that impact both their level of happiness and their economic growth.
